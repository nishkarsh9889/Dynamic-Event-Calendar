# Dynamic Event Calendar

A feature-rich **Dynamic Event Calendar** built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This application allows users to efficiently manage their daily events, offering functionality to add, edit, and delete events, with enhancements like local storage support, overlapping prevention, and color-coded event categories.

## Features

### 1. Add Events
- Easily add events by selecting a specific day on the calendar.

### 2. Edit/Delete Events
- Edit or delete events for any selected day to keep your schedule updated.

### 3. Local Storage Support
- All events are saved to the browserâ€™s local storage, ensuring persistence even after a page reload.

### 4. Overlapping Prevention
- Prevents the addition of duplicate events (events with the same name and time).

### 5. Color-Coded Event Categories
- Events are categorized into **Work**, **Personal**, and **Others** for easy identification:
  - **Work**: Blue
  - **Personal**: Green
  - **Others**: Purple

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface and handling state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For creating a responsive and visually appealing design.
